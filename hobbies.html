    <header><h1>My Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    I actively pursue a range of creative and technical hobbies that complement my academic growth. My artistic interests include watercolor and acrylic painting, sketching, quilling, and calligraphy, while I also enjoy photography and videography, particularly capturing the sky, and editing content using tools like DaVinci Resolve. I am passionate about writing, including poetry, storytelling, and journaling, . Additionally, I engage in problem-solving activities like Rubik’s cube solving and create content for platforms such as YouTube and social media reels, combining my technical and creative skills into meaningful projects.
