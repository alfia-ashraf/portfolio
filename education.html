        <h1>My Academic Journey</h1>
    </header>
    My academic trajectory reflects sustained discipline, adaptability, and intellectual growth. Throughout school, I maintained consistent academic performance while actively engaging in leadership roles and structured co-curricular activities, contributing to well-rounded development. I completed my secondary education with strong board results (88%+) and pursued Science at the higher secondary level, building a rigorous foundation in analytical subjects. I subsequently dedicated focused years to competitive medical entrance preparation, which strengthened my problem-solving ability, conceptual clarity, and academic endurance under pressure. I am now commencing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering, approaching this transition with strategic intent and a commitment to academic excellence, technical depth, and continuous advancement.
